# Score Matching and Flows
Connection between score matching, minimum probability flow and Wasserstein gradient flows, together with the proposal of a two inference algorithm: Langevin Matching and Augmented Score Matching.

We suggest consulting the "manuscript" file for a better overview.
We also attach a file on Wasserstein Spaces and a file on RKHS, to whoever might be interested in going deeper into the theory.
